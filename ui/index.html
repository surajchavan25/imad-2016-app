Love can defeat that nameless terror. Loving one another, we take the sting from death
Well, when you think you love somebody, you love them. That's what love is.
Love is the expansion of two natures in such fashion that each include the other, each is enriched by the other.
Love is an echo in the feelings of a unity subsisting between two persons which is founded both on likeness and on complementary differences. Without the likeness there would be no attraction; without the challenge of the complementary differences there could not be the closer interweaving and the inextinguishable mutual interest which is the characteristic of all deeper relationships.<br><br><br><br>
The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.<br><br><br><br>
Who sings of all of Love's eternity
Who shines so bright
In all the songs of Love's unending spells?
Holy lightning strikes all that's evil
Teaching us to love for goodness sake.
Hear the music of Love Eternal
Teaching us to reach for goodness sake.
<br><br><br><br>
To love is to will the good of the other.
